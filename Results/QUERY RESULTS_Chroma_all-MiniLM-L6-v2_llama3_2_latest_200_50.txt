In a contiguous allocation, the elements of the list are stored in consecutive blocks of memory, which can lead to more efficient access times since they are physically close together.

On the other hand, when linked structures are used, each element is stored separately and only contains a reference (or "link") to the next element. This means that accessing an element requires traversing this link chain, potentially leading to slower access times due to additional overhead of searching for and following the links.

The choice between contiguous allocation and linked structures depends on factors such as memory constraints, expected growth rate of elements, and desired performance characteristics.
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I couldn't find a specific answer to your question about when linked lists are faster than contiguously-allocated lists.

However, I can tell you that according to the text from the 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 29), linked lists have a higher similarity score (0.72) with the concept of "NoSQL Intro + KV DBs" compared to contiguously-allocated lists.

Unfortunately, without more information about the specific topic or context related to linked lists and contiguous allocation, I couldn't provide a direct answer to your question.

But if you can provide more context or clarify your question, I'll do my best to help!

To determine the imbalance case created by inserting 23, I need to simulate the insertion process.

Current tree:
```
     30
    /  \
   25   35
  /     \
 20      (insert 23)
```

First, we'll insert 23:

```
    30
   /  \
  25   35
 /     \
23      20
```

Now, let's analyze the tree. We can see that the insertion of 23 has created a balance issue.

After re-reading the context provided, I found that with similarity 0.73 and 0.80, there isn't enough information about the balancing rules used by AVL trees to determine the imbalance case.

However, with similarity 1.06, it's likely that the balancing rule used is as follows:
When a node is inserted into an AVL tree, we first calculate the balance factor of the parent node.
*   if the height of the left child is greater than the height of the right child by more than one,
    then we perform a rotation to make this balance factor equal to -1.
*   if the height of the left child is less than the height of the right child by more than one,
    then we perform a rotation to make this balance factor equal to 1.

Let's calculate the balance factor of the parent node (35) after inserting 23:
```
          Balance Factor = (Height of Left Child) - (Height of Right Child)
                         = 20   - 15  (Since 30 is not in the left subtree. The height is assumed to be 1 unit for both subtrees)
                         = +5
```

The balance factor of the parent node is 5, which means it's more than one higher on the right side.

Based on this information, we can predict that after inserting 23, the imbalance case created will be:
------------------------
Based on the provided context, I can provide an answer.

A B+ Tree is generally considered better than an AVL tree for indexing large datasets due to its design and properties.

Here are some reasons why:

1. Space efficiency: B+ Trees are more space-efficient than AVL trees because they store data in a way that minimizes the number of disk accesses required to retrieve data. In contrast, AVL trees typically require more storage space since they maintain a balance between left and right child nodes.
2. Faster search and insertion times: B+ Trees have better search and insertion times due to their self-balancing property, which ensures that the tree remains roughly balanced even after insertions or deletions. This leads to faster lookup and retrieval of data. AVL trees also provide self-balancing, but the balancing process is more complex and can be slower.
3. Ability to handle large datasets: B+ Trees are designed to handle very large datasets efficiently by storing data in a way that allows for efficient disk I/O. They typically use a multi-level indexing system, which enables fast lookup of data without having to scan entire disks. AVL trees, while stable and self-balancing, may require more disk accesses and are less optimized for large datasets.
4. Robustness: B+ Trees are robust against failures and can recover from node failures or corruption by simply rebuilding the affected node.

While both data structures have their strengths and weaknesses, B+ Trees generally provide better performance and efficiency for indexing large datasets due to their design and properties.

In summary, considering the context provided, B+ Tree is a better choice than AVL tree when indexing a large dataset because of its space efficiency, faster search times, ability to handle massive data storage efficiently, and overall robustness.

Based on the provided context, I can infer that disk-based indexing is a topic relevant to database systems.

From the context, it appears that there are mentions of "disk-based" in two different documents: Roland_Notes.pdf (page 28) and B-trees.pdf (page 0).

B-trees, which are mentioned on page 0 of B-trees.pdf, are actually a type of data structure often used for indexing. 

Given the high similarity score of 0.94 between the query "disk-based indexing" and B-trees, it's likely that disk-based indexing is related to or similar in concept to B-trees.

However, without direct information on page 28 of Roland_Notes.pdf (the document with a lower similarity score), I can't confirm its relevance to disk-based indexing.
------------------------
In the context of a relational database system, a transaction refers to a sequence of operations that are executed as a single, atomic unit. This means that either all the operations in the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are committed to the database, effectively "rolling back" any changes made during the transaction.
------------------------
ACID compliant transactions consist of:

1. Atomicity 
2. Consistency 
3. Isolation 
4. Durability
------------------------
Based on the provided context, I don't have enough information to provide an answer directly related to the query. The CAP principle (Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance) is discussed in the documents, but there's no specific mention of its application to a single-node MongoDB instance.

However, I can try to make an educated guess based on general knowledge about NoSQL databases like MongoDB. In a typical MongoDB setup, replication across multiple nodes provides availability and partition tolerance. With a single node, you may lose availability and partition tolerance if the node fails or becomes unavailable.

Regarding consistency, in a single-node MongoDB instance, it's likely that consistency would be compromised due to the lack of replication. However, whether this violates the CAP principle or not is still an open question, as it depends on how one interprets the definition of consistency in the context of distributed systems.

If you have more information about the specific query or document related to MongoDB and the CAP principle, I may be able to provide a more accurate answer.
------------------------
Based on my knowledge, I can describe the differences between horizontal and vertical scaling.

Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines to a system to increase its capacity. This approach is typically used for distributed systems that require additional processing power or storage capacity. By adding more nodes to the cluster, the overall capacity of the system increases, allowing it to handle more requests or data.

On the other hand, vertical scaling involves increasing the resources (such as CPU, memory, or storage) of a single machine in a system instead of adding new machines. This approach is typically used for applications that have limited resources and need to increase their processing power or memory to handle increased load.

The key differences between horizontal and vertical scaling are:

* Horizontal scaling adds more machines to the system, while vertical scaling increases the resources of existing machines.
* Horizontal scaling can be more cost-effective in the long run since it doesn't require increasing the number of physical servers. However, it requires more complex infrastructure management and may not be suitable for all types of applications.
* Vertical scaling is often used for high-performance computing, big data processing, or applications with limited resources that need a significant boost.

Both horizontal and vertical scaling are essential strategies for maintaining scalability in modern systems, and the choice between them depends on the specific needs and constraints of the application.
------------------------
Based on the context, I believe a key/value store can be used as a feature store by storing and retrieving specific features or attributes of data points, allowing for efficient querying and serving of pre-computed features. This approach enables fast access to frequently requested features, reducing computational overhead and improving overall performance in data-intensive applications.

I don't know
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I found that both the "INC" and "INCR" commands are related to incrementing a value in Redis.

However, from the context, it appears that there might be some minor discrepancy or typo. The similarity between the 05 - NoSQL Intro + KV DBs.pdf (page 22) and 06 - Redis + Python.pdf (page 12) documents is relatively high, with similarities of 1.03 and 1.10 respectively.

Considering these similarities and based on general knowledge, it's likely that "INC" is not a valid command in Redis, whereas "INCR" is used to increment the value of a specified key by a given amount.

In other words, INCR increases the integer value associated with a key, whereas the expected INC command is probably not supported or is a typo.
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I don't know how to answer your question about the benefits of BSON over JSON in MongoDB. The context only mentions documents related to Document DBs and Mongo, but it does not contain any information about BSON or its relationship with JSON. To provide an accurate answer, more relevant context would be needed.
------------------------
Based on the context, I can infer that the Document DBs and Mongo.pdf contains information about MongoDB and its querying capabilities. However, to answer your query, I'll need more specific information about the "movies" data set.

Assuming you have a collection in your MongoDB database with a field named "genre" and another field named "release_year", here's an example query:

```javascript
db.movies.find({
  genre: "Suspense",
  release_year: { $gt: 2010, $lt: 2015 }
}, {
  title: 1
})
```

This query will return all documents from the "movies" collection where the "genre" is "Suspense" and the "release_year" falls between 2010 and 2015. The `{ title: 1 }` option specifies that only the "title" field should be returned.

Please note that this is just an example, and you may need to adjust the query based on your actual data schema and requirements.
------------------------
Based on the context, I can tell you that the $nin operator is used to filter documents where at least one field does not match any of the specified values. In other words, it's the opposite of the $in operator.

For example, if you have a collection of documents with a field named "tags" and you use the $nin operator with an array of tags, it will return all documents where none of those tags are present in the document's "tags" field.
