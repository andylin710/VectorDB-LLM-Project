Based on the context, it seems that the query relates to computer science or programming concepts.

A list where memory is contiguously allocated means that all elements in the list share the same block of memory. This can lead to efficient access and modification of elements in the list, as adjacent elements are stored in consecutive locations.

On the other hand, a list where linked structures are used means that each element (or node) contains a reference (or pointer) to the next element in the sequence. Each element is allocated separate memory locations. This approach can be beneficial for dynamic lists or when the order of elements matters, as nodes can be inserted or deleted without shifting adjacent nodes.

The main difference between these two approaches is:

- Contiguous allocation: Faster access and modification times because elements are stored in consecutive memory locations.
- Linked structures: More flexible, but potentially slower access and modification times due to the need to follow pointers.
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I found that according to the information from "02 - Foundations.pdf" (page 4), linked lists are faster than contiguously-allocated lists when memory is not allocated contiguously.

In other words, if the memory allocation for an array or list does not happen contiguously in physical memory locations, a linked list can be more efficient.
------------------------
To answer your question, I'll need to analyze the context of the AVL tree provided.

The root node is 30, and it has two children: a left child (25) and a right child (35). The leftmost leaf node is 20. We want to add 23 to this tree.


After adding 23, the new tree structure would be:

         30
       /   \
      25    35
     / \     \
   20  23   45

Since we added a node (23) with value greater than its parent's value (30), it creates an imbalance of type "Left-heavy" or "Right-heavy".
------------------------
Based on the provided context, I can answer your query accurately.

A B+ tree is generally considered better than an AVL tree for indexing a large dataset due to its disk-friendly structure. In a B+ tree, data is stored in sorted order and split into fixed-size blocks (called blocks) that fit within a single disk block or page. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data on disk, making it suitable for large datasets.

In contrast, AVL trees are primarily used for indexing data in memory, where the cost of disk I/O is not as significant. They maintain a balance between the left and right subtrees to ensure search efficiency, but they do not inherently consider the disk storage aspect.

The context from the provided PDFs supports this answer, with page 0 mentioning B-trees and pages 2-3 discussing AVL trees in detail, without making any direct comparisons that would suggest B+ trees are superior.
------------------------
I don't know. The provided context doesn't mention anything about disk-based indexing or its importance in database systems. It appears to be related to a document comparison process, where the similarity between PDF pages is being compared.
------------------------
In the context of a relational database system, a transaction is a sequence of operations that are executed as a single, all-or-nothing unit. This means that if any part of the transaction fails or cannot be committed, the entire transaction is rolled back and no changes are made to the data. Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity by providing a way to group multiple operations together and commit them as a single, coherent unit.
------------------------
Based on the provided context, I couldn't find any information about ACID compliant transactions in the given PDFs. The context seems to be related to NoSQL databases and key-value stores.

Therefore, my answer is:

"I don't know"
------------------------
Based on the context, I found that the CAP principle is discussed in relation to distributed databases. The CAP principle states that a distributed database can at most achieve two out of three guarantees:

1. Consistency (all nodes see the same data)
2. Availability (data is always accessible)
3. Partition tolerance (the system continues to function even if some nodes are down)

Regarding MongoDB, it's a NoSQL database that can be deployed as a single-node instance or a distributed cluster. When applied to a single-node MongoDB instance, the CAP principle doesn't make sense because a single node can only provide two of the three guarantees: consistency and availability.

A single-node MongoDB instance is not partition-tolerant, as it's only one physical node that stores data. If the node fails or becomes unavailable, the database becomes inconsistent and unavailable.

In contrast, distributed MongoDB clusters can achieve all three CAPs (if designed correctly), providing high availability, consistency, and partition tolerance.
------------------------
Based on my training data, I can provide an answer to your query.

Horizontal scaling and vertical scaling are two different strategies used in cloud computing and distributed systems to increase scalability.

**Horizontal Scaling (also known as Horizontal Partitioning or Scaling Out)**:

In this approach, additional servers are added to the system to handle increased load. This involves distributing the workload across multiple servers, each of which can process a portion of the total data or requests. When the demand increases, new servers are spun up to handle the additional load, and when it decreases, they can be taken down.

**Vertical Scaling (also known as Horizontal Partitioning or Scaling Up)**:

In this approach, more resources (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) are added to a single server to increase its capacity. This involves scaling up the existing infrastructure by upgrading hardware components or adding more nodes to an existing cluster.

The key differences between horizontal and vertical scaling are:

* **Number of servers**: Horizontal scaling adds new servers, while vertical scaling increases resources on existing servers.
* **Load distribution**: In horizontal scaling, the load is distributed across multiple servers, whereas in vertical scaling, a single server handles the increased load.
* **Cost and complexity**: Horizontal scaling can be more cost-effective and easier to manage than vertical scaling, as it involves adding new infrastructure components rather than upgrading existing ones.

In summary, horizontal scaling adds new servers to distribute the workload, while vertical scaling increases resources on existing servers to handle increased demand.
------------------------
Based on the context, a key-value store can be used as a feature store because it stores data in a simple key-value pair format, making it ideal for storing and retrieving features at scale.

In this setup, the key represents a unique identifier for a particular feature, while the value is the actual feature data. This allows for fast lookup, storage, and retrieval of features, which can be useful when serving as a feature store.
------------------------
I don't know. The provided context does not mention when Redis was originally released. It only mentions the similarities between different PDF files, but it doesn't provide any information about the release date of Redis.
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I don't have enough information to determine the exact answer to your question about the difference between the INC and INCR commands in Redis.

However, from general knowledge, the INC command increments a key by 1, whereas the INCR command also increments a key by 1. It seems that these two commands are equivalent in Redis, and I couldn't find any information in the provided context that suggests they behave differently.

If you need more detailed information or clarification on this topic, please provide additional context or clarify what specific difference you're looking for (e.g., behavior with floating-point numbers, different data types, etc.).
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I don't know the specific details about BSON and its benefits over JSON in MongoDB, as the relevant information seems to be limited to the provided PDFs. The context mentions Document DBs and Mongo.pdf, but it doesn't specifically mention BSON or JSON. Additionally, the similarities mentioned appear to be with other documents, rather than providing direct information on the topic of BSON vs JSON.

If you could provide more context or clarify which document contains the relevant information, I'd be happy to try and help further.
------------------------
Based on the context, I can provide a MongoDB query to retrieve the desired results.

Here is the query:

```javascript
db.movies.find({
  $and: [
    { releaseDate: { $gte: "2010-12-31" } },
    { releaseDate: { $lt: "2016-01-01" } },
    { genre: "Suspense" }
  ]
}, {
  title: 1
})
```

In this query:

*   `$and` is used to combine multiple conditions using the logical AND operator.
*   The `releaseDate` condition uses the `$gte` and `$lt` operators to find documents with release dates between December 31, 2010, and January 1, 2016 (inclusive).
*   The `genre` condition specifies that we want to include only movies from the "Suspense" genre.
*   Finally, `{ title: 1 }` limits the output to only include the `title` field in the result.

Please adjust the date range according to your specific requirements.
------------------------
The $nin operator is used to find documents where at least one field does not exist within the specified array value. In other words, it returns all documents where none of the values in the array match.

For example:

```bash
db.collection.find({name: /John/, age: { $nin: [20, 25] } })
```

This query would find all documents where the name is John and the age is not 20 or 25.
