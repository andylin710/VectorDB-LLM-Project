According to the context, the main difference between a list where memory is contiguously allocated and a list where linked structures are used is as follows:

A contiguous allocation lists store all records in a single block of memory. The total size of each record (x) is multiplied by the number of records (n), resulting in n * x bytes of memory.

On the other hand, a linked structure uses individual records that are linked together using memory addresses. Each record requires an additional space for 1 or 2 memory addresses to point to the next element of the list.
------------------------
Linked lists are faster than contiguously-allocated lists when performing random insertions, not random access. This is because in a linked list, each node points to the next element of the list (except for the last one, which points to nil/null), allowing for efficient insertion at either the front or end of the list in O(1) time. In contrast, contiguously-allocated lists require shifting all elements after the insertion point, resulting in a slower O(n) time complexity.
------------------------
To determine the imbalance case that is created when inserting 23 into the given AVL tree, we need to follow the insertion process and check for any imbalances.

Initially, the tree looks like this:
```
  30
 /  \
25   35
 \     \
  20    (empty)
```

1. Perform a lookup for the key 23: It's not in the tree.
2. Add a new node with key 23 to the left of node 20.

After inserting 23, the tree now looks like this:
```
  30
 /  \
25   35
 \     \
  20    23
       /
      11 (new)
```

Now, let's analyze the tree for any imbalances:

- The node containing key 20 has a height of 2.
- The left subtree of 20 has a height of 1.
- The right subtree of 20 contains key 23 and is empty.

Since the difference in heights between the two subtrees of node 20 is greater than 1, this creates an imbalance.

I don't know. The context provided only discusses AVL trees, their properties, and balancing in binary search trees, but does not mention B+ trees or their advantages over AVL trees.

Disk-based indexing is a technique used in relational database management systems (RDBMS) to improve query performance by creating a data structure that facilitates faster lookup, retrieval, and manipulation of data. It involves storing additional metadata about the data on disk, which allows the database to quickly locate specific values or rows based on the index.

In traditional disk storage, data is stored in a linear sequence, making it difficult to find specific data without scanning the entire dataset. Indexing solves this problem by creating a separate data structure that contains references to the location of each value or row in the original dataset. This allows the database to quickly access the desired data without having to scan the entire disk.

Disk-based indexing is important for several reasons:

1. **Improved query performance**: By providing a fast and efficient way to locate specific data, indexing can significantly improve query performance, reducing the time it takes to retrieve data.
2. **Reduced I/O operations**: With an index, the database can quickly find the desired data without having to read the entire dataset from disk, which reduces the number of input/output (I/O) operations and improves overall system performance.
3. **Efficient storage management**: Indexing helps manage storage more efficiently by allowing the database to store data in a way that minimizes the amount of unnecessary data on disk.

In summary, disk-based indexing is an essential component of relational database systems, as it provides a crucial layer of abstraction between the physical storage and the logical structure of the data, enabling faster query performance, reduced I/O operations, and more efficient storage management.
------------------------
In the context of a relational database system, a transaction is a sequence of one or more CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations performed as a single, logical unit of work. It ensures that either the entire sequence succeeds (COMMIT) or fails (ROLLBACK or ABORT), helping to maintain data integrity, error recovery, concurrency control, reliable data storage, and simplified error handling.
------------------------
The four components of ACID compliant transactions are:

1. Atomicity: Ensures that either all or none of the changes in a transaction are committed.
2. Consistency: Ensures that the database is left in a consistent state after a transaction has completed, meeting all integrity constraints.
3. Isolation: Prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other, ensuring that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data.
4. Durability: Ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive even in the event of a system failure.
------------------------
The CAP principle doesn't make sense when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance because it's inherently inconsistent with one of its fundamental constraints.

In a distributed system, you can sacrifice consistency to achieve higher availability and partition tolerance. However, in a single-node database like MongoDB, the definition of consistency is different from that of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

ACID consistency ensures that database transactions are processed reliably, but it's not compatible with the CAP theorem's concept of consistency as "every user of the DB has an identical view of the data at any given instant".

In a single-node MongoDB instance, you can sacrifice some consistency to achieve higher availability and partition tolerance. For example, you might use the "wait for journal" or "w" option to allow for temporary inconsistencies in order to improve write performance.

Therefore, when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance, the CAP principle doesn't make sense because it's not possible to satisfy all three constraints (consistency, availability, and partition tolerance) simultaneously.

Based on the provided context, I can answer your query accurately.

Horizontal scaling, also known as "scaling out," involves adding more nodes to a system to increase its capacity. This approach is simpler because it doesn't require modifying the existing architecture of the system. However, there are practical and financial limits to this approach, mainly due to the increased complexity and cost associated with managing multiple nodes.

On the other hand, vertical scaling, also known as "scaling up," involves increasing the power and capabilities of individual components or nodes within the system. This approach is easier because it doesn't require significant changes to the existing architecture. However, there are practical and financial limits to this approach as well, mainly due to the cost and complexity of maintaining larger, more powerful systems.

In other words, horizontal scaling involves adding more "heads" (nodes) to a system, while vertical scaling involves making each "head" smarter or stronger.
------------------------
A key-value store can be used as a feature store by storing features as key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier for the feature and the value is the actual feature data.

This approach leverages the simplicity of key-value stores to focus on fast lookups and retrievals of specific features. Since keys are hashed values that allow for O(1) retrieval, it enables efficient querying of features by their IDs.

In this context, scalability becomes an important consideration, as a distributed key-value store can handle large numbers of features. However, this also means dealing with eventual consistency, where multiple nodes may have different versions of the same feature data until they converge on the same value.

Overall, using a key-value store as a feature store simplifies feature management and enables fast retrieval of specific features, making it suitable for applications that require quick access to feature data.

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the release date of Redis. However, I can tell you that Redis is an open-source, in-memory database that was first released in January 2008 by Salvatore Garbersi and later joined by Domenico Di Meo.
------------------------
Based on the provided context, it appears that both 'INC' and 'INCR' are used in the same code snippet.

The code snippet mentions `r.incr("<SYM>clickCount:/abc<SYM>")`, which suggests that 'INCR' is a valid command in Redis.

However, I don't see any mention of 'INC' being used as a Redis command in the provided context. It's possible that 'INC' might be an alternative spelling or notation for 'INCR', but it's not explicitly stated as a separate command in the given text.

Therefore, based on the available information, I can only confirm that 'INCR' is a valid Redis command, but I don't have enough context to determine if 'INC' is equivalent or distinct from 'INCR'.
------------------------
According to the context, it seems that BSON (Binary JSON) is similar to JSON, but with additional features such as support for extended types like Date and BinaryData. However, there is no direct comparison between BSON and JSON benefits in the provided texts.

But I can provide some general information about BSON and its advantages over JSON:

BSON (Binary JSON) is a binary-encoded serialization of a JSON-like document structure that allows you to work with types not allowed in regular JSON. The main benefits of using BSON include:

1. Efficient encoding and decoding: Since BSON is binary-encoded, it can be more efficient than JSON for storing and retrieving large amounts of data.
2. Reduced space overhead: By storing data in a compact binary format, BSON can reduce the space overhead compared to JSON, which can lead to improved performance and scalability.
3. Support for extended types: BSON allows you to work with extended types like Date and BinaryData, which may not be supported by regular JSON.

However, without more specific information from the provided texts or additional context, I couldn't provide a definitive answer on what benefits BSON has over JSON specifically in MongoDB.
------------------------
Based on the context, I can see that the MongoDB queries provided earlier are related to retrieving movies released in 2010 or Drama. However, none of these queries directly relate to suspense.

To write a query based on the movies data set that returns the titles of all movies released between 2010 and 2015 from the suspense genre, we need to modify the existing queries. Here's one possible way to do it:

```mongodb
db.movies.find({
    year: { $gte: 2010, $lte: 2015 },
    genres: "Suspense"
})
```

This query will return all movies released between 2010 and 2015 that have a genre of Suspense.
------------------------
In a Mongo query, the `$nin` operator is used to select documents where the specified field does not exist in the list of values.

Example:
```javascript
db.movies.find({ rated: { $nin: ["PG", "PG-13"] } })
```
This would return all documents in the `movies` collection where the `rated` field is either null, undefined, or missing, rather than being one of the values in the list `["PG", "PG-13"]`.

Note that the `$nin` operator is similar to the `$notIn` operator in some other databases, but it's a MongoDB-specific operator.
