Based on the provided context, I can answer your query.

In a memory-contiguous allocation (also known as contiguous storage), all elements of a data structure are stored in adjacent memory locations. This means that each element is stored one after the other, and there's no overhead associated with pointers or references to other elements.

On the other hand, linked structures use non-adjacent memory locations to store elements. Each element (or node) contains a reference to the next element in the sequence, forming a chain of linked nodes. This approach can be more efficient for dynamic data that frequently inserts or deletes elements, but it requires additional memory to store those pointers.

In summary, the main difference between a list with contiguous allocation and one using linked structures is:

* Contiguous allocation: All elements are stored in adjacent memory locations, with no overhead associated with pointers.
* Linked structure allocation: Each element stores a reference to the next element, forming a chain of linked nodes, which can be more efficient for dynamic data but requires additional memory.

I don't know. The provided context does not mention linked lists or contiguous-allocated lists, so I couldn't find any information related to the query in the given text.

I don't know how to answer your question about an AVL tree, but I can help with other queries related to the provided context.

However, based on the context you provided earlier, it seems like you are asking me to identify an imbalance case in an AVL tree. 

To do this, let's analyze the given tree structure: 

     30
    /  \
   25   35
  / 
 20

Inserting 23 would create a left-left or right-right imbalance because 23 is less than both 25 and 30 (or more precisely in this case greater than 20), but its height with the current tree structure will still be higher than that of either 20, which is not balanced.

However, the most significant imbalance created by inserting 23 would likely be a right-right or left-left imbalance because it's inserted at the leaf node.
------------------------
I don't know. The provided context does not mention B+ Trees or AVL trees, nor does it discuss indexing techniques in detail. However, I can suggest that the topic of indexing and tree data structures is likely to be covered in the course material.

If you'd like, I can try to provide some general information on B+ Trees and AVL trees, but keep in mind that this would not be directly related to the provided context.
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I can answer your query accurately.

Disk-based indexing is a technique used in relational database management systems (RDBMSs) to improve query performance by allowing for faster data retrieval. Instead of storing all data in physical storage devices, RDBMSs use indexes, which are data structures that provide direct access to specific columns or attributes of a table, thereby reducing the need to scan entire tables during queries.

This technique is important because it allows database systems to quickly locate and retrieve specific data without having to read and process the entire dataset. This leads to significant performance improvements in query execution times, making disk-based indexing a crucial component of efficient relational databases.
------------------------
In the context of a relational database system, a transaction is a sequence of operations that are executed as a single, all-or-nothing unit of work. It ensures that either all changes are made permanently or none are, to maintain data consistency and integrity. Transactions typically involve multiple operations such as inserting, updating, or deleting data, and are used to prevent partial updates or losses of data in the event of failures or errors.
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I couldn't find any specific information about ACID compliant transactions. The text focuses on database systems (RDBMSs and NoSQL databases), data engineering, big data, and AWS services.

I don't know how to describe the four components of ACID compliant transactions.
------------------------
I don't know. The context provided doesn't mention the CAP principle or its application to a single-node MongoDB instance. While the context mentions NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, and their data models, it doesn't specifically discuss the CAP theorem or its implications for single-node instances of MongoDB.
------------------------
I don't know how to answer that question based on the provided context, as it appears to be related to academic assignments and grading policies rather than computer science or programming concepts like scaling. The text does not mention "horizontal" and "vertical scaling" at all.

However, I can provide a general answer to your question if you'd like:

Horizontal scaling refers to increasing the number of computing resources (such as CPU cores, memory, or nodes) to handle increased workload or traffic. This is often achieved through techniques such as load balancing, adding more servers to a cluster, or using cloud services.

Vertical scaling, on the other hand, involves upgrading individual computing resources (such as upgrading from a small server to a larger one with more processing power) to improve performance without increasing the number of resources overall.

If you'd like to know more about scaling concepts in computer science, please let me know and I'll be happy to help!
------------------------
Based on the context provided, it appears that a key/value store is not explicitly mentioned as a use case for data models in NoSQL databases, but rather there's an "Maybe Vector Databases" section which might imply other types of data stores.

However, I can provide information on how a key/value store can be used as a feature store. A key/value store typically uses a simple key-value pair to store data, where the key is unique and identifies the value that corresponds to it.

In the context of a feature store, a key/value store could be used to store metadata about features, such as their names, descriptions, and versions. Each feature would be stored under a specific key, allowing for efficient lookups and updates.

For example, in a feature store, you might have keys like "feature_123" or "product_feature_abc", which correspond to values containing the feature's metadata, such as its name, description, and version number.

This approach allows for fast and flexible storage and retrieval of feature metadata, making it suitable for use cases where features need to be quickly updated or accessed.

I don't know. The provided context seems to be related to a class introduction and getting started, with information about assignments, submissions, gradescope, GitHub, and AWS services, but it doesn't mention Redis or its release date.
------------------------
I don't know. The provided context does not mention Redis or its commands.

I don't know. The provided context does not mention BSON or its comparison to JSON in MongoDB. It only discusses general concepts related to NoSQL databases, data models, and data engineering, but it does not specifically address the benefits of BSON over JSON.
------------------------
To write a MongoDB query that returns the titles of all movies released between 2010 and 2015 from the suspense genre, you can use the following query:

```javascript
db.movies.find({
  releaseDate: { $gt: "2010-01-01", $lt: "2016-01-01" },
  genre: "Suspense"
}).select({ title: 1 })
```

This query uses the `$gt` and `$lt` operators to select documents where the `releaseDate` is greater than January 1, 2010, and less than January 1, 2016. It also filters by the `genre` field to include only suspense movies.

Please note that this assumes a MongoDB collection named "movies" with fields "title", "releaseDate", and "genre". The exact query syntax may vary depending on your MongoDB version and schema.
------------------------
The "$nin" operator in MongoDB is used to find documents that do not have a specific value in a particular field. It's the opposite of the "$in" operator, which finds documents that have a specific value in a particular field.

For example, if you want to find all documents where the "category" field does not contain the string "electronics", you would use the following query:
```
db.collection.find({ category: { $nin: ["electronics"] } })
```
This will return all documents where the "category" field is not equal to "electronics".

Note that the "$nin" operator can be used with arrays as well, in which case it will match documents where the array field does not contain any of the specified values.
