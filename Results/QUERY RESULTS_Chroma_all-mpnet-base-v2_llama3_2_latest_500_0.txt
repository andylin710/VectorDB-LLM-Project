Based on the context, I believe the answer to your question can be inferred from the information provided.

According to what's mentioned in the context, page 3 of "02 - Foundations.pdf" has a similarity of 0.69 with the current query (list). Page 4 has a similarity of 0.44, indicating some difference or new concepts introduced.

Unfortunately, without the content of pages 3 and 4 explicitly stated in this interaction, I can only assume that page 3 discusses list data structures where memory is contiguously allocated. A contiguous allocation implies that all elements in the list are stored in adjacent memory locations, which can lead to more efficient access patterns but may also have limitations when it comes to inserting or deleting elements.

On the other hand, linked structures imply storing each element separately and linking them through a common pointer, allowing for insertions and deletions without having to shift all subsequent elements. While this offers flexibility in terms of list operations, it does come at a cost due to increased memory usage per element.

Without explicit content on these topics from the provided context, I don't know if there's any direct comparison or contrast mentioned regarding linked lists with contiguous allocation.
------------------------
Based on the context, it appears that the answer can be inferred from the similarities between pages of a PDF document.

The most similar page to the query ("When are linked lists faster than contiguously-allocated lists?") is From 02 - Foundations.pdf (page 3) with a similarity of 0.89.

However, I don't have information on when linked lists would be faster than contiguously-allocated lists. The context seems to focus on similarities between pages of a PDF document rather than providing an answer to the query.

Therefore, I must say: I don't know.

To answer this question, I'll need to know how the AVL tree would balance with the insertion of 23.

Since I don't have the exact diagram of the AVL tree from the provided context, I'll use the information from pages 3 and 4 of the PDF to infer the balancing process.

From page 5, you asked me to add 23 to the AVL Tree below. However, I can provide a general answer based on how an AVL tree would balance with inserting 23.

Here's the corrected step-by-step explanation:

1. First, insert the value 23 into the tree, and it would look like this:
    ```
      30
     / \
    25  35
   / \
  20 23
```
2. Now, let's analyze the balance factor for each node in the tree.

The left subtree of 30 has a height of 3 (20 -> 25 -> 23) and a balance factor of -1.
 The right subtree of 30 has a height of 2 (35) and a balance factor of 0.
 The left subtree of 25 has a height of 2 (20 -> 25) and a balance factor of 1.
 The right subtree of 25 has a height of 1 (23) and a balance factor of -2.

3. To balance the tree, we need to find the node with the largest imbalance factor.
   In this case, it's the left subtree of 30 with a balance factor of -1 and the left subtree of 25 with a balance factor of -2.

4. Since the left subtree of 25 has a larger imbalance factor (-2 vs -1), we need to balance around node 25.

5. Now, let's analyze the balancing cases for node 25:

   Case 1: Node 25 is in an L-branch (left branch).
    In this case, we rotate right at node 25.
    The new tree will look like:
      ```
     30
    / \
   25 35
  /
20 23
```

   Case 2: Node 25 is in a R-branch (right branch)
    Since the value of 25 in the original AVL tree is smaller than its right child, we should check whether the right child has to be rotated as well.

     In this case, since the balance factor is -2 and node 23 is higher than node 20, there is a potential imbalance on the left side after rotation. Thus, another rotation is required for further balancing.


6. So, with inserting 23 into the AVL tree, we create an unbalanced case: The left subtree of 25 with a balance factor of -2.

Therefore, the imbalance case created by adding 23 to the AVL Tree below is that of LLL (Left Left Left) type imbalance at node 20

Based on the context provided, it appears that B+ trees are generally considered better than AVL trees for indexing large datasets. One reason for this is that B+ trees can handle a much larger number of keys and disk I/O operations compared to AVL trees.

AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees that ensure the tree remains approximately balanced by rotating nodes, which can be an expensive operation. In contrast, B+ trees are ordered trees with multiple levels of indexing, allowing them to store large amounts of data on disk while still maintaining efficient query performance.

In particular, B+ trees have a few key advantages over AVL trees for indexing large datasets:

*   **Higher Storage Efficiency**: B+ trees can store more keys in the same amount of space as AVL trees because they use a multi-level indexing system, where only leaf nodes are stored on disk. This makes them well-suited for very large datasets.
*   **Reduced Disk I/O Operations**: By storing data in multiple levels of indexing, B+ trees reduce the need for disk I/O operations. Each level has fewer keys than the one above it, reducing the number of page faults that occur when a new key is inserted or updated.

In summary, while AVL trees are self-balancing and efficient for maintaining order, B+ trees offer superior storage efficiency and reduced disk I/O operations, making them better suited for indexing large datasets.

Based on the provided context, I don't have specific information about disk-based indexing from the given PDFs. However, I can provide a general answer.

Disk-based indexing is an indexing technique used in relational databases to improve query performance by reducing the number of disk accesses required to retrieve data.

In traditional disk-based indexing, the index is stored on disk and contains pointers to the locations of the data in the database. When a query is executed, the database system must read the index into memory (RAM) and then access the corresponding data on disk. This can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially for large datasets.

Disk-based indexing aims to minimize these overheads by pre-computing and storing the index values in a way that allows for efficient retrieval of data. By indexing the disk, database systems can quickly locate the required data, reducing the need for disk accesses and improving overall query performance.

Therefore, disk-based indexing is important for database systems as it enables faster query execution times, improved scalability, and reduced latency.

In the context of a relational database system, I don't know. The provided texts appear to discuss "Moving Beyond the Relational Model" and "Roland_Notes", but they do not mention transactions.

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 

I don't know.
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I believe the answer can be inferred from the CAP principle itself.

The CAP principle, which stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance, was initially introduced by Eric Brewer in 2000. It states that it is impossible for a distributed database to simultaneously guarantee all three: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

When applied to a single-node MongoDB instance, the concept of "partition tolerance" doesn't apply because there are no partitions (i.e., separate nodes) to consider. In fact, a single-node instance doesn't even meet the requirements for availability, as it can become unavailable if the node fails or is taken offline.

Therefore, when applied to a single-node MongoDB instance, the CAP principle doesn't make sense because "partition tolerance" and "availability" are not relevant or meaningful concepts in this context. The consistency guarantee may still be important, but it's not mutually exclusive with availability in the case of a single-node instance.

So, while the CAP principle was designed to address distributed databases, its applicability to a single-node MongoDB instance is limited because it doesn't meet the conditions for partition tolerance and availability.

Based on the provided context, I don't have specific information about the query "Describe the differences between horizontal and vertical scaling." However, I can provide a general answer.

Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to an application to increase its capacity, usually by horizontally partitioning data across multiple nodes. This approach is often used to handle increased traffic or demand for a particular service.

Vertical scaling, on the other hand, involves increasing the power and capabilities of individual servers within an existing infrastructure to improve performance without adding new hardware.
------------------------
Based on the context, I can provide an answer.

A key-value store can be used as a feature store by leveraging its core functionality of storing and retrieving data based on a unique identifier (key). In this context, the key would represent the feature or version of a feature, and the value would represent the actual feature data.

When a new feature is deployed, its associated data can be stored in the key-value store with the corresponding key. Later, when accessing the feature data, the application can retrieve the value associated with the desired key, allowing for efficient and scalable storage and retrieval of feature data.

This approach enables features to be versioned and stored separately from the application's data store, making it easier to manage different versions of a feature and track changes over time.

According to the context, I can provide information on the difference between the INC and INCR commands in Redis.

The INC command increments a value by 1 and returns the new value as a string. It does not return the previous value.

On the other hand, the INCR command also increments a value by 1 but returns the previous value before the increment operation.

I don't know. The provided context appears to be about Document DBs and MongoDB, but it does not mention BSON or its benefits over JSON.
------------------------
Based on the context, I can infer that the data set is related to MongoDB documents.

Here's a sample MongoDB query that should return the titles of all movies released between 2010 and 2015 from the suspense genre:

```javascript
db.movies.find({
  $and: [
    { releaseYear: { $gte: 2010 } },
    { releaseYear: { $lte: 2015 } },
    { genre: "Suspense" }
  ]
})
```

This query uses the `$and` operator to combine two conditions:

1. `releaseYear` is greater than or equal to 2010 (`$gte`) and less than or equal to 2015 (`$lte`)
2. The movie belongs to the suspense genre

The resulting documents should contain the titles of all movies that match these criteria.

Note: This assumes that the data set has fields for `releaseYear` and `genre`, which are case-sensitive. Adjust the query accordingly if your field names or casing differ.
------------------------
The $nin operator is used to find documents that do not match any of the specified values. In other words, it returns all documents where at least one field does not exist in the given array.

For example, if you have a collection of users with a 'roles' field, and you want to get all users who are not administrators, you would use the $nin operator like this:

db.collection.find({ roles: { $nin: ["admin"] } })

This query will return all documents where the 'roles' field is not equal to "admin".
