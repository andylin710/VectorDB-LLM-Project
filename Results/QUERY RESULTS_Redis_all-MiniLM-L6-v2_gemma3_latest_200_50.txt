Here’s the difference between lists using contiguous memory allocation and those using linked structures:

*   **Contiguous Memory Lists:** In this approach, the elements of the list are stored in a single, continuous block of memory. Each element occupies a specific amount of space, and the list is essentially a sequence of these blocks.
    *   **Advantages:** Fast access to elements (using an index), simple implementation.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Can be inefficient if the list grows beyond the initially allocated block (requiring reallocation and copying), fixed size (unless dynamic resizing is implemented, which can be slow).

*   **Linked Lists:** In a linked list, elements (called nodes) are not stored contiguously in memory. Each node contains the data and a pointer (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
    *   **Advantages:** Dynamic size – can grow or shrink as needed, efficient insertion and deletion (especially in the middle of the list), memory is allocated and deallocated individually.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Slower access to elements (requires traversing the list from the beginning), more complex implementation.

In essence, contiguous lists are like a row of numbered boxes, while linked lists are like a chain of beads, where each bead points to the next.
------------------------
Linked lists are faster than contiguously-allocated lists when accessing elements by index. In a contiguous list, accessing an element requires traversing from the beginning until the desired index is reached. This sequential access can be slow, especially for large lists and elements near the end. Linked lists, on the other hand, allow direct access to any element by following the pointers from the head to the desired node, making them faster for random access.

The insertion of 23 creates a right imbalance. Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Insert 23:** 23 is inserted as a new node.
2.  **Tree Structure:**
    *   30
       / \
      25  35
     /    \
    20     23

3.  **Imbalance:** The node 25 now has a single child (23) and a right child (35). This violates the AVL tree property of balanced heights.

Therefore, the imbalance case created is a **right-right** imbalance.
------------------------
B+ Trees are generally a better choice than AVL trees for indexing large datasets due to their design which is optimized for efficient range queries and large volumes of data. AVL trees are self-balancing, which makes them good for maintaining balance and fast single-key lookups, but they don't handle large datasets and range queries as efficiently as B+ Trees. B+ Trees use a multi-level structure that allows for efficient sequential access, which is crucial for large datasets.
------------------------
Disk-based indexing is a technique used in database systems to speed up data retrieval. Instead of scanning the entire table to find rows matching a search criterion, a disk-based index is created. This index is essentially a separate data structure (like a B-tree) that maps index values to the corresponding row locations on the disk.

Here’s why it’s important:

*   **Faster Queries:** When a query uses a WHERE clause with an indexed column, the database can quickly locate the relevant rows in the table using the index, rather than scanning the entire table. This dramatically reduces query execution time.
*   **Improved Performance:** Disk-based indexing is crucial for performance, especially in large databases with many rows.
*   **B-tree Structure:** Most disk-based indexes are implemented using B-trees, which are efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting data.

Essentially, it’s a shortcut that allows the database to quickly find the data you’re looking for.
------------------------
In a relational database system, a transaction is a logical unit of work that consists of one or more SQL operations. It’s treated as a single, indivisible unit. Transactions ensure data integrity by guaranteeing that either all operations within the transaction complete successfully (a *commit*) or none of them do (a *rollback*). This prevents partial updates and maintains the consistency of the database.
------------------------
ACID compliant transactions consist of four key components:

1.  **Atomicity:** Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. Either all changes within the transaction are completed successfully, or none are.
2.  **Consistency:** Guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. It enforces rules and constraints defined within the database.
3.  **Isolation:** Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction operates as if it’s the only one running.
4.  **Durability:** Guarantees that once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent and will survive even system failures (e.g., power outages).


------------------------
The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of the following three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. It doesn't make sense to apply it to a single-node MongoDB instance because a single node inherently has no partitions to tolerate. Therefore, the constraints of the theorem don't apply.
------------------------
Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to a system to handle increased load. This distributes the workload across multiple machines. Vertical scaling, on the other hand, involves increasing the resources (CPU, RAM) of a single server. Essentially, you’re making one server more powerful. 

Here’s a table summarizing the key differences:

| Feature          | Horizontal Scaling | Vertical Scaling |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Approach**      | Adding more servers | Increasing server power |
| **Resource Change**| Adds more machines | Upgrades a single machine |
| **Cost**          | Can be more cost-effective for large workloads | Can become expensive quickly |
| **Complexity**    | Generally more complex to manage | Simpler to manage |
| **Failure Impact**| Failure of one server has less impact | Failure of the server has a greater impact |
------------------------
A key/value store can be used as a feature store by storing individual features as key-value pairs. Each key represents a unique feature, and the value can be the feature's data (e.g., a numerical value, string, or boolean). This provides a simple and fast way to retrieve features on-demand for model training and inference.

------------------------
In Redis, both `INC` and `INCR` commands increment a key’s value, but they differ in their behavior when the key doesn’t exist.

*   **`INCR`**: This command *always* increments the value of a string or numeric value by 1. If the key does not exist, it creates the key and sets its value to 1.

*   **`INC`**: This command increments the value of a string by 1. However, if the key does not exist, `INC` will return -1.

In essence, `INCR` is safer to use when you want to ensure a key is created if it doesn't exist, while `INC` is more concise but returns -1 if the key is absent.
------------------------
BSON offers several benefits over JSON when used with MongoDB:

*   **Binary Format:** BSON is a binary JSON-like data format. This makes it more compact and efficient to transmit and store compared to JSON’s text-based format.
*   **Data Type Support:** BSON supports a wider range of data types natively, including dates, doubles, and binary data, which are not directly supported in JSON. MongoDB uses these native types for storage and querying, leading to better performance and data integrity.
*   **Schema Flexibility:** While JSON is often used with schemas, BSON in MongoDB is more flexible. MongoDB’s schema-less nature works well with BSON’s ability to store various data types.
*   **Indexing:** BSON’s binary format allows for more efficient indexing, which can significantly speed up query performance.

In essence, BSON is optimized for MongoDB’s document-oriented database model, providing better performance, storage efficiency, and data type support compared to JSON.

```javascript
db.movies.find({
  genre: "suspense",
  release_year: {
    $gte: 2010,
    $lte: 2015
  }
})
```
------------------------
The `$nin` operator in a MongoDB query means "not in." It filters documents based on a field that does not contain any of the values specified in the array. 

For example, if you have a field called `colors` and you want to find all documents where the color is not "red" or "blue", you would use:

`{ "colors": { $nin: ["red", "blue"] } }`
