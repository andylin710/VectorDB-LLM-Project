The main difference between a list where memory is contiguously allocated and a list where linked structures are used is how the memory is allocated and accessed.

In a contiguous allocation, all elements of the list are stored in a single block of memory that is allocated as one unit. This means that all n*x bytes (where x is the number of bytes each record takes up) are allocated at once, and the list can be accessed efficiently by using the starting address of the first element.

In contrast, a linked list uses individual records with additional space for memory addresses. Each node in the list points to the next element of the list, except for the last node which points to nil/null. This means that each record takes up x bytes of memory plus an extra amount of memory to store the pointers to the next elements.

The key differences are:

* In contiguous allocation, all elements are stored in a single block of memory, while in linked lists, each element is stored separately and has additional space for pointers.
* Contiguous allocation allows for O(1) insertion at either end of the list, while linked lists also allow for O(1) insertion at either end, but also provide an efficient way to insert elements at any position in the middle.

Overall, contiguous allocation can be more memory-efficient and faster for certain operations, while linked lists provide more flexibility and scalability for dynamic data structures.
------------------------
Linked lists are faster than contiguously-allocated lists for random insertions, but slower for random access.

To add 23 to the given AVL tree, we need to perform a lookup first.

Since 23 is not in the tree, we will add it as a new node in the leaf position where the lookup ended. 

After adding 23, the tree becomes:

     30
    /  \
   25   35
  / \  \
 20 23 35

Now, let's analyze the imbalance case created by inserting 23.

The original AVL tree was balanced, but after inserting 23, we need to check if any node still meets the balance condition (i.e., the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees is at most 1).

In this case, we can see that the left subtree of 35 has a height of 2 (20 -> 25 -> 30) and the right subtree of 23 has a height of 0. The difference in heights is 2, which exceeds the balance condition.

Therefore, inserting 23 creates an imbalance case where the node with key 35 does not meet the AVL property.
------------------------
I don't know. The provided context discusses AVL trees, but it does not mention B+ Trees or their comparison to AVL trees in the context of indexing a large dataset. The context only talks about the definition and properties of AVL trees, and how they are "nearly balanced" binary search trees that maintain logarithmic height at no more than logarithmic cost.

Based on the provided context, I can answer your query accurately.

Disk-based indexing is a technique used in relational databases to speed up data retrieval by creating an index on a specific column or set of columns. The index is stored on disk, allowing the database to quickly locate and retrieve data without having to scan the entire table.

This is important for database systems because it increases efficiency in several ways:

1. **Reduced search time**: By using an index, the database can quickly find specific values within a column, reducing the need for linear scans of the entire table.
2. **Improved query performance**: Disk-based indexing enables databases to optimize queries more effectively, leading to faster response times and improved overall system performance.
3. **Increased scalability**: Indexing allows databases to handle larger amounts of data by providing a quick way to access and retrieve specific information.

Overall, disk-based indexing is a crucial component of relational database systems, enabling faster data retrieval, improved query performance, and increased scalability.
------------------------
In the context of a relational database system, a transaction is a sequence of one or more of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations performed as a single, logical unit of work. It is either fully committed (SUCCEEDS), where all changes are applied to the database, or it is completely rolled back (FAILS), where none of the changes are applied and the database is returned to its previous state. This ensures data integrity, error recovery, concurrency control, reliable data storage, and simplified error handling.
------------------------
The four components of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) compliant transactions are:

1. Atomicity - Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit and either fully executed or not executed at all.
2. Consistency - Maintains the database in a consistent state by ensuring all data meets integrity constraints after a transaction is committed.
3. Isolation - Prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other, ensuring that each transaction sees a consistent view of the data.
4. Durability - Ensures that once a transaction is committed and successful, its changes are permanent and even in the event of a system failure.
------------------------
The CAP principle doesn't apply to a single-node MongoDB instance because a single node cannot provide all three capabilities simultaneously.

In a single-node instance, consistency and availability are guaranteed, as there is no network partition or failure to consider. The database can always provide the latest data in response to requests, which means consistency is ensured.

However, partition tolerance is not possible for a single-node instance, as it relies on the ability of the system to handle network failures between segments of the distributed system. A single node does not have multiple segments, so it cannot maintain operations in the event of such a failure.

Therefore, when applying the CAP principle to a single-node MongoDB instance, you would say that it violates the partition tolerance aspect, as it is not designed to handle network failures or partitions between segments of the distributed system.
------------------------
Based on the provided context, here's a description of the differences between horizontal and vertical scaling:

Horizontal scaling refers to adding more nodes (computers) to an existing system, allowing it to handle increased demand and improve scalability. This approach is often used in distributed computing models where data can be split across multiple servers. With horizontal scaling, the architecture doesn't need to be modified significantly, making it a relatively straightforward process.

On the other hand, vertical scaling involves increasing the power or capacity of individual servers or nodes within an existing system, without adding new hardware. This approach is often less complex and cost-effective than horizontal scaling but has practical and financial limits.

In summary, horizontal scaling involves adding more computers to handle increased demand, while vertical scaling involves upgrading individual servers to improve performance without adding new hardware.
------------------------
Based on the provided context, a key-value store can be used as a feature store because of its simplicity and scalability features. Key-value stores are designed to handle simple CRUD operations, which is ideal for storing and retrieving features. Additionally, their ability to scale horizontally by adding more nodes makes it easy to manage large amounts of data, such as features.

Key-value stores lend themselves well to API creation, allowing developers to easily integrate feature data into their applications. By using a key-value store as a feature store, organizations can quickly and efficiently manage their features, ensuring that they are always up-to-date and accessible.

The simplicity of the key-value store's data model also makes it easy to implement a basic caching mechanism, where frequently used features are stored in memory (in-memory DB) for faster access. This is particularly useful when dealing with time-series data or feature flags.

I don't know. The provided context does not mention the original release date of Redis.
------------------------
The INC command in Redis increments a value by a specified amount. 

On the other hand, the INCR command in Redis atomically increments a field by one.
------------------------
Based on the provided context, it appears that BSON (Binary Serialized Object Notation) is a binary-encoded serialization of a JSON-like document structure in MongoDB. 

One key benefit of BSON compared to JSON mentioned in the context is that BSON supports extended types not part of basic JSON, such as Date and BinaryData.
------------------------
To write a MongoDB query that returns the titles of all movies released between 2010 and 2015 from the suspense genre, you can use the following query:

```javascript
db.movies.find({
  $and: [
    { year: { $gte: 2010, $lte: 2015 } },
    { genres: "Suspense" }
  ]
})
```

This query uses the `$and` operator to combine two conditions: `year` being between 2010 and 2015 (inclusive) and `genres` being equal to `"Suspense"`.

Alternatively, you can also use the `$or` operator with a subdocument to achieve the same result:

```javascript
db.movies.find({
  $or: [
    { year: { $gte: 2010, $lte: 2015 } },
    {
      genres: {
        $elemMatch: {
          $eq: "Suspense"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

This query uses the `$or` operator to combine two conditions: `year` being between 2010 and 2015 (inclusive) or `genres` containing a field with value `"Suspense"`.

Note that in both queries, I've assumed that the `movies` collection has a field named `year` to store the release year of each movie. If your collection uses a different field name for this information, you'll need to adjust the query accordingly.
------------------------
In MongoDB, the `$nin` operator is used to select documents where a field does not contain one or more specified values. It's the opposite of the `$in` operator, which selects documents where a field contains one or more specified values.

For example, if you have a collection `movies` and you want to find all movies that are neither rated `PG` nor `PG-13`, you would use the following query:

```bash
db.movies.find({ rated: { $nin: [ "PG", "PG-13" ] } })
```

This will return all documents in the `movies` collection where the `rated` field is not equal to either `"PG"` or `"PG-13"`.
