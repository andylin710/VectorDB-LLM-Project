According to the provided context, the main differences between a contiguous allocation list and a linked list are:

1. **Memory Allocation**: In a contiguous allocation list, all n * x bytes are allocated as a single chunk of memory, whereas in a linked list, each record only requires x bytes of memory plus additional space for 1 or 2 memory addresses to store the pointers to the next element in the list.

2. **Data Structure**: A contiguous allocation list is structured by storing all elements contiguously in memory, whereas a linked list is structured by linking individual records together using memory addresses, forming a chain-like structure.

3. **Insertion Operations**: Contiguous allocation lists have O(n) time complexity for inserting new values at any position (either front or end), while linked lists have an average O(1) time complexity for inserting new values at either the front or end due to the pointer-based system, assuming a hash table is used to store the pointers.
------------------------
Linked lists are faster than contiguously-allocated lists when it comes to random insertions, according to the text from page 6 of "02 - Foundations.pdf". This is because for linked lists, each record needs only an additional space for 1 or 2 memory addresses, whereas for contiguously-allocated lists, all n * x bytes are allocated as a single chunk of memory, requiring more overhead.
------------------------
To add 23 to the AVL tree, we need to perform a lookup and insert it into the correct position.

Let's start by performing the lookup:

The tree is:
```
 30
 / \ 
25  35
 \   
 20  
```
We search for the key 23. Since it's not present in the current tree, we add a new node with the key 23 to the left of 20.

After adding the new node, the tree becomes:
```
 30
 / \ 
25  35
       \
        23
```

Now, let's check if there is an imbalance:

The height of the left subtree (rooted at 20) is 1.
The height of the right subtree (rooted at 23) is -1.

Since the difference in heights between the two subtrees is greater than 1, we need to perform a rotation to balance the tree.

In this case, an LR rotation would be necessary because the first link is pointing to the left and the second link is pointing to the right. After performing the rotation, the corrected imbalance-free AVL tree will have the same height for all nodes.
------------------------
I don't know. The provided context discusses B-trees and AVL trees, but does not mention B+ trees. B+ trees are another type of data structure that can be used for indexing large datasets, but their characteristics and advantages over AVL trees are not mentioned in the given context.
------------------------
According to the context, disk-based indexing refers to storing indexes on disk alongside the actual data. This allows for faster searching by a specific column (in this case, "id" or "specialVal"), as it enables a more efficient search process.

Disk-based indexing is important because it provides an alternative approach to linear scanning of columns, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. By storing indexes on disk, database systems can achieve faster query performance, making it a crucial aspect of relational database management systems (RDBMS).

The context also mentions that the only other option for searching by "specialVal" is a linear scan of the column, but this approach would require duplicating data or sorting it in a way that's space inefficient. Disk-based indexing offers a solution to these problems, making it an essential technique for improving database performance.
------------------------
In the context of a relational database system, a transaction is a sequence of one or more CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations performed as a single, logical unit of work. This means that either the entire sequence succeeds and the changes are committed to the database, or the entire sequence fails and the database is rolled back or aborted to maintain data integrity.
------------------------
Based on the provided context, I can summarize the four components of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Durability, and Isolation) compliant transactions as follows:

1. **Atomicity**: A transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit that must be fully executed or not executed at all.
2. **Consistency**: A transaction ensures that the database remains in a consistent state, with all data meeting integrity constraints.
3. **Durability**: Once a transaction is completed and committed successfully, its changes are permanent and survive system failures.
4. **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other to prevent conflicts and ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other's execution.

Please note that the concept of Isolation is mentioned in the context as "Pessimistic Concurrency", but it refers to ensuring that transactions are executed without interference from other transactions, which is essentially what isolation does.
------------------------
The CAP principle doesn't apply to a single-node MongoDB instance because it requires at least three nodes (or replicas) to be able to guarantee more than two of the mentioned properties simultaneously. A single-node instance can provide availability and partition tolerance, but it cannot ensure consistency or availability simultaneously, making the CAP principle inapplicable.

In other words, the CAP theorem states that a distributed system must sacrifice either consistency or availability to achieve partition tolerance. Since MongoDB is designed as a master-slave replication model with at least three nodes (primary, replica 1, and replica 2), it can provide high availability and tolerate network partitions while maintaining consistency across replicas.

However, in the case of a single-node instance like MongoDB's primary node on disk (not the in-memory primary node used for read operations), it prioritizes durability over consistency to ensure data safety. This means that if one node fails, the system can recover by reading from another node and potentially writing back to the failed node once it comes back online, ensuring consistency is maintained even when a single node fails.

So, while MongoDB does follow some principles of CAP in its distributed setup, it doesn't strictly adhere to the three-part CAP theorem for individual nodes due to its design focusing on durability rather than high availability and partition tolerance.
------------------------
According to the provided context, here are the differences between horizontal and vertical scaling:

Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):

* Involves adding more computers or nodes to a distributed system
* Appears to users as one computer
* Allows for easier distribution of load and improved fault tolerance
* Can be less problematic with modern systems

Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):

* Involves upgrading individual machines or servers within an existing architecture
* Requires modifying the architecture, which can be more difficult and costly
* May become impractical due to financial limits or practical constraints
------------------------
A key-value store can be used as a feature store by utilizing its simplicity, scalability, and speed to efficiently manage and retrieve features or metadata associated with data. Here's a brief overview of how:

1. **Simple Data Model**: Key-value stores have an extremely simple data model, which makes it easy to define and store features as key-value pairs (e.g., feature ID as key, feature definition as value).
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling is straightforward in key-value stores, allowing you to easily add more nodes to handle increasing amounts of feature data.
3. **Speed**: Retrieving a feature by its ID can be done in O(1) time, making it suitable for fast lookups and updates.

To use a key-value store as a feature store:

* Store features as key-value pairs (e.g., `feature_123` => `{ "name": "Feature 123", "description": "This is Feature 123" }`)
* Use the key-value store to retrieve feature metadata by its ID
* Update feature definitions by updating the corresponding value in the key-value store
* Utilize the simplicity of the data model for simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

Keep in mind that key-value stores are not designed for complex queries or joins, so if you need to perform aggregations or filtering on features, a different data structure might be more suitable.
------------------------
I don't know. The provided texts do not mention the release date of Redis.
------------------------
I don't know. The query does not mention the "INC" command, but rather the "INCR" command, which is an increment command that atomically increments a specified value by one and returns the previous value. However, there is no mention of the "INC" command in the provided context.
------------------------
According to the provided context, BSON (Binary JSON) has several benefits over regular JSON:

1. It allows working with types not allowed in regular JSON, such as dates and binary data.
2. It keeps space overhead to a minimum.

Additionally, BSON is designed to be efficiently encoded and decoded, which is an important aspect of document databases like MongoDB.
------------------------
To write a MongoDB query that returns the titles of all movies released between 2010 and 2015 from the suspense genre, you can use the following query:

```javascript
db.movies.find({
  $and: [
    { year: { $gte: 2010, $lte: 2015 } },
    { genres: "Suspense" }
  ]
})
```

This query uses the `$and` operator to combine two conditions: `year` between 2010 and 2015, and `genres` equal to "Suspense".
------------------------
In MongoDB, the $nin operator is used to match documents where at least one field does not exist in the specified array.

For example, if you want to find all movies with a rating that is not "PG-13", you would use:

db.movies.find({ rated: { $nin: ["PG-13"] } })

This query finds all documents in the movies collection where the value of the "rated" field is not in the array ["PG-13"].
