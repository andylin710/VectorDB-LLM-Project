A contiguous allocation list is one in which all elements of the list share the same contiguous block of memory, whereas a linked structure list has individual elements that point to each other using pointers. In the latter case, each element knows the location of its next neighbor (or previous neighbor), allowing for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position within the list.

In terms of memory usage, contiguous allocation is generally more space-efficient than linked structures because it eliminates the overhead associated with storing the links between nodes in a linked list.
------------------------
Based on the provided context, I don't have specific information about when linked lists are faster than contiguously-allocated lists. The context seems to be related to a lecture or course material about large-scale information storage and retrieval, specifically discussing data structures and databases.

However, in general computer science and data structures, linked lists can be faster than contiguously-allocated lists (also known as arrays) when:

1. **Frequent insertions or deletions**: Linked lists are more efficient for dynamic memory allocation because they don't require contiguous blocks of memory to be allocated.
2. **Small datasets**: For small datasets, the overhead of linked list operations (e.g., node creation and traversal) might outweigh the benefits of linked lists. However, as the dataset size grows, linked lists can become more efficient due to their ability to handle insertion and deletion without shifting large blocks of data.
3. **Cache performance**: In some cases, linked lists can exhibit better cache locality than contiguously-allocated lists, especially when accessed sequentially. This can lead to faster performance in scenarios where cache misses are common.

Without specific information from the provided context, it's difficult to provide a precise answer or quantify the exact conditions under which linked lists would be faster than contiguously-allocated lists.

To answer your query, I need to understand that you're asking me to analyze the given AVL tree and determine what imbalance case would be created by adding a new node with value 23.

Based on the provided context from "From 01 - Introduction & Getting Started.pdf" (page 15), I know that in an AVL tree, when inserting a new node, it must meet certain balance factor conditions to ensure the tree remains balanced. The balance factor of a node is calculated as the height of its left subtree minus the height of its right subtree.

For the given AVL tree:

     30
    /  \
   25   35
  / 
 20

The imbalance case created by inserting 23 would be when the new node's value (23) causes an imbalance. 

To determine this, let's calculate the balance factor of each node before and after inserting 23:

Before insertion:
- Node 30: Balance factor is not relevant here as we're adding a child to one of its children.
- Node 25: Height = 2; Left child height = 1; Right child height = 1 (assuming root node's height is 1 for simplicity), so balance factor = -0.
- Node 35: Balance factor is not relevant here as we're adding a parent to one of its children.
- Node 20: Height = 2; Left child height = 1; Right child height = 1 (assuming root node's height is 1 for simplicity), so balance factor = -0.

After insertion:

- The new node with value 23 will be inserted as a right child of node 20, making its height 2.
- Node 20: Height = 3; Left child height = 2; Right child height = 2 (assuming root node's height is updated to maintain balance), so balance factor = -1.
- The tree looks something like this: 
    30
   /  \
  25   35
 / \
20   23 

Considering the balance factor of node 20, which becomes -1 after insertion. According to the AVL tree properties, if a node's balance factor is greater than 1 or less than -1 (and we are assuming it must be an imbalance), then rotation is needed.

The new balance factor created by adding 23 into the given tree can create an L-shaped case for node 20, where the insertion has caused an imbalance because its height exceeds one of its children.

Based on the context, I don't know how to answer this question as it's not relevant to the provided text. The text appears to be related to information storage and retrieval, specifically discussing different types of databases (RDBMSs, NoSQL database systems) and cloud services (AWS). There is no mention of indexing or data structures like B+ Trees or AVL trees.

However, I can suggest that a B+ Tree might be considered better than an AVL tree when indexing a large dataset due to its efficiency in handling large amounts of data. B+ Trees are particularly well-suited for disk-based storage and have good performance characteristics even with very large datasets.

If you'd like more information on why B+ Trees or other data structures are chosen for indexing, I can try to provide some general insights based on my training data.
------------------------
Based on the provided context, I found relevant information about disk-based indexing.

Disk-based indexing refers to the use of a data structure that indexes data stored on physical disks, allowing for efficient retrieval and access of data. This technique is commonly used in relational databases (RDBMSs) as well as other database systems.

In the context of RDBMSs, indexing enables faster query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate specific data records. Disk-based indexing is important because it reduces the number of disk accesses required to retrieve data, thereby improving overall system performance and efficiency.

Additionally, disk-based indexing helps to:

* Reduce storage requirements
* Improve query performance
* Enhance data security and integrity

In the context of NoSQL databases, indexing is also crucial for achieving efficient data retrieval and access.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I can conclude that disk-based indexing is an important technique in database systems, enabling faster query performance, reduced storage requirements, and improved overall system efficiency.
------------------------
In the context of a relational database system, a transaction is a sequence of operations that are executed as a single, atomic unit. This means that either all of the operations in the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are, to maintain data consistency and prevent partial updates.

For example, suppose you're checking out a book from a library using your debit card. You remove your card from your wallet, swipe it to pay for the book, and then place it back in your wallet. If everything goes smoothly, you've successfully completed the transaction. However, if the library's computer crashes or your card is declined, none of the steps are complete, so the "transaction" fails.

In relational databases, transactions typically involve a set of SQL commands that modify data, such as INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs. The database ensures that these operations are executed reliably, either in their entirety or not at all, to maintain data integrity and consistency.
------------------------
I don't know. The provided context doesn't mention ACID compliant transactions. It mentions data storage and retrieval, relational models, NoSQL databases, big data tools, and services on AWS, but not ACID compliant transactions specifically.
------------------------
The CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) principle is actually not a limitation of RDBMSs in general, but rather a fundamental constraint on distributed systems. A single-node MongoDB instance, being a centralized system, does not have to worry about the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

In other words, since it's a single node, you can achieve high consistency (all data is always up-to-date), high availability (the system is always accessible), and high partition tolerance (it can handle network partitions). There's no need to sacrifice any of these properties to meet the others in this case.

I don't know. The provided context appears to be related to academic expectations, grading breakdowns, and the instructor's contact information, but it does not mention horizontal or vertical scaling. If you could provide more context or clarify what you are referring to, I would be happy to try and assist you further.

A key/value store can be used as a feature store by leveraging its simplicity and speed in storing and retrieving large amounts of data. Here's a brief overview:

In a key/value store, data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs, where each key uniquely identifies the data and the value is the actual data itself.

To use a key/value store as a feature store, you can follow these general steps:

1. Store features as key-value pairs: Each feature would be represented by a unique key (e.g., "feature_1", "feature_2", etc.) and its corresponding value (e.g., the actual feature data).
2. Use timestamps or versioning for storage: To manage changes to features over time, you can store multiple versions of each feature as separate key-value pairs, with a timestamp or version number indicating when each version was stored.
3. Implement caching and expiration: To reduce latency and improve performance, you can implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed features in memory (e.g., RAM) and set expiration times for less frequently accessed ones to remove stale data.
4. Utilize query capabilities: Most key/value stores provide efficient query capabilities, allowing you to retrieve specific features or ranges of features based on their keys.

Keep in mind that while a key/value store can be used as a feature store, it may not offer the same level of complexity and customization as dedicated feature stores designed specifically for this purpose.

I don't know. The provided context mentions Redis, but it does not mention when it was originally released. However, based on external knowledge, I can tell you that Redis is a popular in-memory data store, and it was originally released in 2005 by Salvatore Sorrentino.
------------------------
I don't know. The provided context seems to be related to a lecture or course material about large-scale information storage and retrieval, specifically focusing on relational models and NoSQL databases. While it does mention various database concepts, including data replication and distribution effects, it doesn't cover Redis or its commands like INC and INCR. If you're looking for information on Redis commands, I'd be happy to try and help with that!
------------------------
I don't know. The provided context does not mention BSON (Binary Serialized Object Notation) or its comparison to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in MongoDB. The context discusses topics such as relational models, NoSQL databases, graph databases, and distributed SQL DBs, but does not touch on the specific benefits of BSON over JSON.
------------------------
Based on the context provided, I'll write a MongoDB query for you.

Assuming the movies collection has a document structure like this:

```json
{
  "_id" : ObjectId,
  "title" : String,
  "genre" : String,
  "year" : Number,
  ...
}
```

Here's the query to find all movies released between 2010 and 2015 from the suspense genre:

```javascript
db.movies.find({
  year: { $gte: 2010, $lte: 2015 },
  genre: "suspense"
}, {
  title: 1 // select only the title field
});
```

This query uses the `$gte` and `$lte` operators to specify a range of values for the `year` field. It also uses the `$eq` operator (not explicitly mentioned in the context, but implied by the use of `$gte` and `$lte`) to match documents where the `genre` is "suspense". Finally, it specifies that only the `title` field should be returned.

Note: This assumes a MongoDB database with a `movies` collection. If your database name or collection name differs, you'll need to adjust the query accordingly.
------------------------
The $nin operator is used to select documents where at least one field does not match any of the specified values. In other words, it returns all documents that do not have any of the values listed in the array.

For example:
```
db.collection.find({name:{$nin:["John", "Jane"]}})
```
This would return all documents where the 'name' field is neither "John" nor "Jane".
